 <br /><h2>Section 1: Introduction to Continuous k-DPP Sampling</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Continuous k-Determinantal Point Processes (k-DPPs) are probabilistic models used to select a fixed number of diverse points from a continuous domain. While k-DPPs on discrete domains have various sampling algorithms, developing efficient methods with provable guarantees for continuous k-DPPs has been a significant challenge. </ul>
<p>A continuous k-Determinantal Point Process (k-DPP) is a probability distribution over finite subsets of size exactly <em>k</em> from a continuous domain, such as a subset of R<sup>d</sup>. For a continuous positive semi-definite (PSD) kernel L: C × C → R, the probability density function p(S) for a subset S is proportional to the determinant of the kernel matrix L<sub>S</sub> (det(L<sub>S</sub>)) [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Continuous k-DPPs are relevant in various fields like physics, mathematics, and computer science, including applications such as modeling eigenvalues of random matrices and hyperparameter tuning [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-18">18</a>].</p>
<p>While sampling from discrete k-DPPs has seen the development of exact polynomial-time algorithms and faster approximate MCMC algorithms [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-7">7</a>, <a href="#ref-13">13</a>], the problem of designing efficient sampling algorithms with provable guarantees for continuous k-DPPs was noted as an open problem [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. The challenge in continuous domains often stems from the infinite nature of the space, making direct adaptations of discrete methods difficult [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 2: MCMC-based Algorithms with Provable Guarantees</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Research has introduced MCMC-based algorithms, particularly the Gibbs sampler, to provide the first provable guarantees for sampling from continuous k-DPPs. The efficiency and implementability of these methods rely on the availability of conditional sampling oracles for the given kernel. </ul>
<p>A significant advancement in sampling from continuous k-DPPs is the development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithms with provable guarantees [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Specifically, the Gibbs sampler has been analyzed for this purpose. The Gibbs sampler operates by iteratively updating a single point in the k-subset: a point is removed, and a new point is sampled from the conditional distribution given the remaining k-1 points, with the probability proportional to the determinant of the kernel evaluated on the new set [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Research shows that this Gibbs sampler mixes rapidly under certain conditions, allowing for the generation of approximate samples from the target k-DPP distribution [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Gibbs sampling schemes have also been considered for k-DPPs in continuous domains like R<sup>d</sup>, where the full conditional distribution for a point can be derived, potentially using methods like inverse CDF sampling if the CDF is analytically computable [<a href="#ref-22">22</a>].</p>
<p>The practical simulation of the Gibbs sampler for continuous k-DPPs and finding a suitable starting distribution depend on the availability of "conditional sampling oracles" [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. A conditional sampling oracle, CD<sub>L</sub>(S, j), is an algorithm that, given a set S, can return a sample from the conditional j-DPP distribution defined by the kernel L, conditioned on S (or on C \ S depending on definition) [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. If efficient oracles for conditional 1-DPPs (CD(., 1) distributions) are available, it becomes feasible to sample a starting state and simulate the Gibbs sampler, leading to a polynomial-time algorithm for sampling from the overall k-DPP [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 3: Application Example: Gaussian Kernels</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> The MCMC approach for continuous k-DPPs has been successfully applied to Gaussian kernels, particularly on the unit sphere. For these kernels, efficient conditional sampling oracles can be implemented, leading to a randomized algorithm with polynomial runtime guarantees. </ul>
<p>A concrete application of the MCMC-based sampling framework for continuous k-DPPs involves Gaussian kernels [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. For a Gaussian kernel G<sub>σ</sub>(x, y) = exp(−(x − y)<sup>T</sup>Σ<sup>−1</sup>(x − y)), particularly when Σ is σI (isotropic Gaussian kernel) and the domain is restricted (e.g., to the unit sphere S<sup>d-1</sup>), it has been shown that a simple rejection sampling algorithm can serve as an efficient conditional sampling oracle (CD(i, 1) oracle) [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. This makes the Gibbs sampler approach practical for these types of kernels and domains.</p>
<p>By combining the rapid mixing results for the Gibbs sampler with the efficient conditional sampling oracles for Gaussian kernels on the unit sphere, a randomized algorithm can generate an ǫ-approximate sample from the k-DPP. For integers d and k ≤ e<sup>d<sup>1−δ</sup></sup> (for some 0 < δ < 1), and a given σ > 0, the algorithm's runtime is O(dk<sup>c</sup> polylog(1/ε)) (paraphrasing, actual complexity from Theorem 5.2 in [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] is O(dk<sup>9</sup> log<sup>4</sup>(k/ε) + dkk<sub>0</sub><sup>8</sup> log<sup>3</sup>(kk<sub>0</sub>/ε)), where specific polynomial terms in k are present), assuming normal distribution samples can be generated in constant time [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. This demonstrates a practical, mathematically grounded solution for sampling from specific types of continuous k-DPPs. The use of Gaussian kernels in R<sup>d</sup> for Gibbs sampling is also noted as an illustrative example elsewhere [<a href="#ref-22">22</a>].</p>
