 <br /><h2>Section 1: Introduction: Generative AI and Workplace Knowledge Dynamics</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Generative AI tools are increasingly integrated into workplaces, offering new avenues for knowledge work, particularly in how employees acquire and apply information. Understanding the diverse factors that influence employee engagement with these tools for knowledge-seeking is crucial for optimizing their benefits. </ul>
<p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT is profoundly altering workplace environments and the nature of knowledge work [<a href="#ref-21">21</a>, <a href="#ref-23">23</a>]. These technologies offer significant potential to automate and augment cognitive tasks, from processing vast amounts of information to generating new content, thereby impacting how individuals seek, acquire, and apply knowledge [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-22">22</a>]. As organizations adopt these tools, it becomes essential to understand the multifaceted factors that drive employee acceptance and utilization of generative AI for knowledge-related tasks [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-24">24</a>]. Effective knowledge seeking and application using AI are influenced by a complex interplay of individual characteristics, perceptions of the technology, the nature of the tasks, and the broader organizational context [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-9">9</a>].</p>
<p>Generative AI can support knowledge workers by providing quick access to information, facilitating learning, and even helping to generate new insights or review existing work [<a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-17">17</a>, <a href="#ref-31">31</a>]. The ability to effectively leverage these tools for knowledge acquisition and application is becoming a key aspect of employee performance and organizational innovation [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]. However, the successful integration of generative AI for knowledge seeking is not automatic and depends on various enablers and barriers that can affect how employees engage with these technologies [<a href="#ref-21">21</a>, <a href="#ref-27">27</a>].</p>
<h2>Section 2: Employee-Centric Factors: Individual Attributes and Perceptions in GenAI Knowledge Seeking</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> An employee's personal characteristics, such as their AI literacy, technophilia, personality traits, and domain expertise, significantly shape their knowledge-seeking behaviors with generative AI. Furthermore, their perceptions of the AI tool, including its usefulness, ease of use, and trustworthiness, are critical in determining their engagement. </ul>
<p>A range of individual employee attributes plays a significant role in their propensity to use generative AI for knowledge seeking. Key among these is AI literacy, which encompasses prior AI experience, training, and education, and is a critical competency for effective AI utilization [<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]. An individual's enthusiasm for technology, or technophilia, also positively influences their engagement with AI tools for learning and knowledge sharing [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Personality traits such as a proactive personality, openness to experience, and intrinsic motivation can lead individuals to more readily explore and leverage AI for its benefits [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-25">25</a>]. Confidence in one's ability to use AI (self-efficacy) and learn with AI also enhances usage and knowledge application [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-24">24</a>]. Domain expertise and familiarity with the task at hand often dictate whether and how employees use AI, with some preferring AI for familiar tasks or well-defined problems where they can better verify outputs [<a href="#ref-7">7</a>, <a href="#ref-14">14</a>, <a href="#ref-22">22</a>, <a href="#ref-31">31</a>]. Habitual use and frequency of interaction with these tools are also strong predictors of ongoing engagement for knowledge tasks [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-16">16</a>]. Additionally, factors like AI awareness, perceptions of opportunity versus risk (e.g., unemployment risk perception), and cognitive styles further modulate how employees approach AI for knowledge acquisition [<a href="#ref-13">13</a>, <a href="#ref-26">26</a>, <a href="#ref-29">29</a>].</p>
<p>Beyond inherent individual traits, employees' perceptions of the generative AI tool itself are crucial. The perceived usefulness or performance expectancy—the belief that the tool will enhance job performance—is a primary driver of adoption and knowledge-seeking behavior [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-16">16</a>, <a href="#ref-20">20</a>, <a href="#ref-24">24</a>]. Similarly, the perceived ease of use or effort expectancy significantly influences whether employees will utilize AI tools to find information [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-16">16</a>, <a href="#ref-25">25</a>, <a href="#ref-30">30</a>]. Trust in the technology and the accuracy of its outputs is vital; if employees do not trust the information provided, they are less likely to rely on it for knowledge-seeking [<a href="#ref-20">20</a>, <a href="#ref-24">24</a>, <a href="#ref-28">28</a>, <a href="#ref-29">29</a>, <a href="#ref-30">30</a>]. User satisfaction, derived from factors like system quality, memorability of interactions, support for non-language barriers, and even a human-like personality in the AI, also encourages continued use for acquiring and applying knowledge [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-24">24</a>].</p>
<h2>Section 3: Contextual Determinants: Task, Organizational, and Social Influences on GenAI Knowledge Seeking</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> The specific characteristics of the task, such as its complexity and clarity, influence how employees use generative AI for knowledge seeking. Organizational factors, including leadership, support, training, and the prevailing learning culture, alongside social influences from colleagues, also play a significant role in shaping these behaviors. </ul>
<p>The nature of the task at hand significantly influences how employees engage with generative AI for knowledge seeking. The clarity of goals and how well-defined a problem is can determine whether an employee turns to AI or other resources; AI is often preferred for tasks with clear objectives [<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]. Task complexity and type (e.g., routine versus creative) also matter, as AI might be used differently for brainstorming new ideas compared to summarizing existing information [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-21">21</a>]. Crucially, the fit between the task requirements and the AI's capabilities (its "capability frontier") impacts effective use; using AI for tasks beyond its current strengths can degrade performance, whereas using it for suitable tasks can enhance it [<a href="#ref-18">18</a>, <a href="#ref-27">27</a>]. The ability to directly apply the knowledge gained from AI tools to practical tasks also boosts engagement [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>].</p>
<p>Organizational context provides the framework within which employees seek knowledge using AI. Leadership styles, such as paradoxical leadership that encourages initiative, can foster AI-driven learning and knowledge sharing [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Organizational support, including the provision of facilitating conditions, adequate training, and the cultivation of a learning-centric atmosphere, is critical for encouraging employees to use AI for knowledge acquisition [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>, <a href="#ref-13">13</a>, <a href="#ref-24">24</a>, <a href="#ref-31">31</a>]. How AI is deployed—whether as a supportive tool or for monitoring purposes—can affect employee willingness to engage with it [<a href="#ref-27">27</a>]. Strategies for employee-AI collaboration and integrating AI into existing workflows also impact adoption and knowledge-seeking patterns [<a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-15">15</a>, <a href="#ref-26">26</a>]. While some studies indicate that social influence from peers and supervisors significantly drives adoption [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>], others suggest its impact might be less direct or significant compared to factors like perceived usefulness or habit, particularly in the context of LLMs [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-16">16</a>, <a href="#ref-28">28</a>]. This highlights the nuanced role of social dynamics in AI adoption for knowledge work.</p>
