 <br />I will personalize the response by <mark>organizing it around the paradox of early token dependence being both a vulnerability and an opportunity</mark>. I will also <mark>use analogies from cognitive science</mark> to explain model mechanisms and <mark>focus on empirical findings and their practical implications</mark>, rather than deep theoretical discussions.

<h2>Section 1: The Double-Edged Sword of Initial Tokens in LLM Safety</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> The first few tokens generated by an LLM are pivotal for its safety because many current safety alignment techniques result in "shallow safety alignment." This means the model's decision to refuse a harmful request or comply is heavily skewed by these initial tokens, presenting both a significant vulnerability and a potential point for defense.</ul>
<p>The initial tokens generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are critically important for their safety due to a phenomenon known as "shallow safety alignment" [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. This means that the safety training an LLM receives primarily adjusts its behavior for the very first few tokens of a response [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. If these initial tokens suggest a refusal (e.g., "I cannot," "I apologize"), the model is likely to continue with a safe response [<a href="#ref-7">7</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>]. However, if these initial tokens are non-committal or affirmative towards a harmful query, the model is much more likely to generate harmful content [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-8">8</a>]. This reliance on initial tokens is partly because alignment training data often features refusals starting at the beginning of a sentence [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. This shallow alignment creates a vulnerability: if an attacker can manipulate the LLM into generating a non-refusal prefix, the model's safety measures can be bypassed [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>]. <mark>Think of it like a first impression in human interaction</mark>; a conversation's trajectory can be heavily influenced by the initial exchange, and a misleading start can lead to undesirable outcomes.</p>
<p>This reliance on early tokens means that the decision to comply with or refuse a request is often made within a very limited number of generation steps [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]. Consequently, if anything triggers a non-refusal prefix, the model's generation can shift towards a harmful trajectory [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. For example, if a model is induced to start a response with "Sure, here's a detailed guide" to a harmful query, it is more likely to continue with problematic information [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. This vulnerability is exploited by various attack methods, such as those targeting the first few tokens or using prefilling techniques [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]. The observation that safety fine-tuning has a more diminished effect on deeper token positions further supports this idea of shallow alignment [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-19">19</a>]. Even benign fine-tuning can inadvertently disrupt these crucial initial token distributions, leading to safety regressions, because these initial tokens often have large gradient updates during fine-tuning processes [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 2: <mark>Exploiting Early Token Dependence for LLM Defense</mark></h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> The critical role of initial tokens in LLM safety also offers a pathway for defense. By identifying and reinforcing "safety trigger tokens"—specific initial tokens that lead to refusal—defense mechanisms can proactively guide LLMs towards safe responses, much like a learned safety reflex.</ul>
<p>The same shallow safety alignment that creates vulnerabilities can also be leveraged to enhance LLM safety [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. Because the first few generated tokens are so influential, defense strategies can be designed to specifically protect or guide the generation of these initial tokens [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>]. These initial tokens, when they lead to a refusal of a harmful prompt, are sometimes called "safety trigger tokens" [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. The core idea is that if these safety trigger tokens can be consistently decoded at the beginning of a response to a malicious prompt, they can activate the model's learned safety patterns and induce a refusal [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. This is <mark>analogous to a cognitive "stop signal" or a learned cautionary response</mark> that is triggered by specific cues, preventing a potentially harmful action before it fully materializes.</p>
<p>Several defense strategies capitalize on this by focusing on the first few tokens. For instance, some methods protect the distribution of the first few tokens during training, while others intervene during the decoding process to ensure the first two to five tokens are safe [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>]. The D-STT algorithm, for example, identifies an LLM's common safety trigger tokens (often just a single token) and explicitly decodes this token as a prefix to the response when a malicious prompt is detected [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. <mark>Empirical studies show</mark> that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies tend to generate highly similar initial refusal tokens (e.g., "I cannot fulfill," "I apologize") [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. By focusing intervention on just the first token or a very small number of tokens, these defenses aim to maintain model usability on benign prompts while incurring minimal computational overhead [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. However, such defenses might struggle against attacks designed to elicit harmful content later in the response, bypassing this initial checkpoint [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 3: <mark>Empirical Evidence and Implications of Early Token Influence</mark></h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Empirical data, such as token probability analyses and perplexity measurements, confirm that current LLM safety measures are often concentrated on the initial tokens. This "shallow" safety means that if a model is forced or tricked into generating affirmative initial tokens, the likelihood of subsequent harmful content generation increases dramatically, underscoring the need for deeper and more robust alignment strategies.</ul>
<p>A growing body of <mark>empirical evidence highlights the profound impact of the first few tokens on LLM safety</mark>. Analyses like KL divergence, which measures the difference between the token distributions of base (unaligned) models and safety-aligned models, show that the most significant divergence—and thus the primary effect of safety alignment—occurs in the initial token positions [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-18">18</a>, <a href="#ref-19">19</a>]. As the response generation progresses, this divergence often diminishes, indicating that the safety alignment's influence wanes for later tokens [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-18">18</a>, <a href="#ref-19">19</a>]. Similarly, log-perplexity studies (where lower perplexity indicates higher probability) demonstrate that once a few non-refusal tokens are generated, the perplexity for subsequent harmful tokens can drop significantly, meaning the model becomes more likely to continue generating harmful content [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]. This suggests that safety fine-tuning is sometimes ineffective at suppressing harmful completions once an affirmative prefix is established [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-10">10</a>].</p>
<p>This concentration of safety alignment on initial tokens has significant <mark>practical implications</mark>. It explains why techniques like prefilling attacks (forcing a non-refusal prefix) or even fine-tuning on a small number of samples with short, affirmative answers can compromise a model's safety [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>]. Fine-tuning, even with benign data, can inadvertently disrupt the delicate balance of initial token probabilities if the new data doesn't use the same refusal prefixes the model was aligned with, leading to "catastrophic forgetting" of safety behaviors specifically for these crucial initial positions [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. For example, fine-tuning an LLM on samples with answers shorter than four tokens can significantly increase its harmfulness score because it predominantly alters the distributions of these critical initial tokens [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]. These findings collectively underscore that current safety alignments are often "a few tokens deep" and that bypassing this initial layer of defense can lead to a cascade of unsafe generation [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-10">10</a>, <a href="#ref-17">17</a>]. This points towards the need for developing alignment methods that instill "deep safety alignment," enabling models to recover from harmful starting conditions or maintain safety awareness throughout the entire generation process [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-10">10</a>, <a href="#ref-21">21</a>].</p>
