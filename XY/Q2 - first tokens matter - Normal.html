 <br /><h2>Section 1: Shallow Safety Alignment and Its Impact on Initial Tokens</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit "shallow safety alignment," meaning their safety mechanisms heavily rely on the first few tokens of a generated response. This makes these initial tokens critical in determining whether the model will produce a harmful or safe output.</ul>
<p>The first few tokens are crucial in LLM safety primarily due to a phenomenon known as "shallow safety alignment" [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]. This means that the safety training of LLMs (like SFT, RLHF, or DPO) predominantly adapts the model's behavior based on the initial few output tokens [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]. If these first tokens initiate a refusal (e.g., "I cannot," "I apologize"), the model is likely to continue with a safe response [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-7">7</a>]. Conversely, if these initial tokens deviate from standard refusal prefixes, even due to benign fine-tuning or specific prompts, the model is much more likely to generate harmful content [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. This reliance on initial tokens is partly because alignment training data often features refusals at the beginning of sentences [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-7">7</a>]. As a result, the decision to comply with or refuse a request is often made within a very limited number of initial generation steps [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>].</p>
<p>This shallow alignment implies that the model's generative distribution is most significantly altered for these initial tokens to induce a refusal response [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. Studies have shown that the KL divergence (a measure of how one probability distribution differs from a second) between aligned and unaligned base models is largest for these initial token positions [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-4">4</a>]. This suggests that current alignment techniques exploit this "shortcut" by focusing on the beginning of the output [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. Consequently, if an attack or even a benign prompt can manipulate the model into generating a non-refusal prefix, the safety measures can quickly break down, leading to the generation of harmful content [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-10">10</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>]. This vulnerability underscores the disproportionate importance of the first few tokens in maintaining LLM safety [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-8">8</a>, <a href="#ref-17">17</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 2: Vulnerabilities and Defense Strategies Related to Initial Tokens</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> The critical role of initial tokens in shallow safety alignment creates specific vulnerabilities, such as prefilling and adversarial suffix attacks. Understanding this also guides the development of defense strategies that focus on protecting or manipulating these early tokens to ensure safe responses.</ul>
<p>The reliance on the first few tokens for safety makes LLMs vulnerable to various attacks. For instance, "prefilling attacks" or "adversarial suffix attacks" exploit this by forcing the model to start its response with a non-refusal prefix, thereby bypassing the shallow safety alignment [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-11">11</a>]. Similarly, even fine-tuning on benign data can disrupt these initial token distributions if the new data doesn't use the same affirmative or refusal prefixes, leading to safety degradation [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]. If an attacker can induce the model to generate even a simple affirmative start like "Sure, here's..." to a harmful query, the subsequent generation is much more likely to be harmful [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]. This is because once harmful tokens start to be generated, safety-aligned models often struggle to recover and suppress the harmful completion [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-10">10</a>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, understanding the importance of initial tokens has informed the design of several defense mechanisms. Some strategies aim to protect the generation of the first few tokens, such as by constraining supervised fine-tuning to protect their distribution or by intervening in the decoding process for the first 2 to 5 tokens [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Other defense strategies explicitly identify and decode "safety trigger tokens" – common initial tokens found in refusal responses (e.g., "I," "I cannot") – to guide the model towards its learned safety patterns [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. These approaches highlight that by controlling or carefully managing the generation of the very first tokens, it's possible to significantly influence the overall safety of the LLM's output [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>, <a href="#ref-14">14</a>]. However, some of these defenses can suffer from instability or impact usability if the intervention is too heavy-handed [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 3: Token-Level Mechanisms and Safety Trigger Tokens</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> "Safety trigger tokens" are specific initial tokens that consistently appear in refusal responses and can guide an LLM towards safe output. Identifying and strategically using these tokens, often just the very first one, forms a basis for defense mechanisms that minimally intervene in the generation process while promoting safety.</ul>
<p>The concept of "safety trigger tokens" further clarifies why the first few tokens matter. These are defined as the initial tokens in refusal responses when an LLM processes a malicious or jailbreak prompt [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. Empirical evidence shows that safety-aligned LLMs tend to use similar safety trigger tokens (e.g., "I", "I cannot fulfill", "I apologize") across various malicious prompts and that effective defense strategies often work by ensuring these tokens are generated [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. For example, studies have observed that after applying certain defenses, the first token generated in response to jailbreak prompts was "I" in 100% of cases for some methods, and sequences like "I cannot fulfill" appeared in over 95% of responses within the first 3 or 4 tokens, mirroring the behavior of the safety-aligned model itself [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p>
<p>Defense algorithms like D-STT leverage this by first identifying the most common safety trigger tokens from a model's refusal responses to harmful queries. They then construct a "safety-aware prior distribution" based on the frequency of these tokens [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. During inference, the defense mechanism samples the very first token from this safety-aware distribution and then allows the model to generate subsequent tokens normally [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. By constraining the intervention to just a single (or very few) initial token(s), these methods aim to trigger the model's learned safety patterns with minimal impact on usability and response time [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]. This targeted approach works because the shallow safety alignment makes the model highly sensitive to these initial cues [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-8">8</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-17">17</a>]. However, this also means such defenses might be less effective against attacks that elicit harmful content later in the response, bypassing the initial token focus [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p>
