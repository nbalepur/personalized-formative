 <br /><h2>Section 1: Background: The Shift from External to Internal Knowledge Retrieval</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLM answers by pulling from external data, but this can be slow and introduce errors. Researchers are now exploring ways for LLMs to use their own internal knowledge as an alternative information source. </ul>
<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a common technique used to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving information from external knowledge sources to produce more accurate and factual answers [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-41">41</a>]. However, this standard approach has several drawbacks. The retrieval process can introduce computational overhead and latency, and the retrieved documents may be irrelevant, outdated, or contain misleading information that can negatively affect the model's response [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-43">43</a>, <a href="#ref-46">46</a>].</p>
<p>These limitations have motivated researchers to explore alternatives, including methods that leverage an LLM's own internal, or parametric, knowledge [<a href="#ref-13">13</a>, <a href="#ref-39">39</a>]. Instead of always relying on an external corpus, some approaches task the LLM with generating its own context or reference material [<a href="#ref-21">21</a>, <a href="#ref-34">34</a>]. This effectively treats the model itself as a retrievable knowledge source [<a href="#ref-13">13</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 2: Generating Knowledge from Within: The LLM as its Own Database</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Yes, researchers have developed methods where LLMs generate their own reference documents or examples to answer questions, effectively retrieving information from their internal knowledge. While this can be more efficient and tailored, its reliability depends on the LLM's scale and the quality of its pre-training data. </ul>
<p>Several studies have investigated having LLMs retrieve information from their own parameters by generating it on demand [<a href="#ref-16">16</a>, <a href="#ref-25">25</a>]. In these frameworks, instead of fetching documents from an external database, the LLM is prompted to produce its own passages, pseudo-documents, or examples based on the input query [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-34">34</a>]. Methods like RECITE, GenRead, and Selfmem are designed for this purpose, using the LLM's generative capabilities to create a knowledge source from its internal knowledge base [<a href="#ref-35">35</a>, <a href="#ref-37">37</a>, <a href="#ref-38">38</a>]. This self-contained approach does not require external labeled data or complex retrieval steps [<a href="#ref-24">24</a>].</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this approach is a subject of ongoing research. Some studies report that LLM-generated documents can be more effective than externally retrieved ones [<a href="#ref-35">35</a>]. However, other work highlights that the quality of this self-generated knowledge is not guaranteed and depends on the model's scale and pre-training data [<a href="#ref-24">24</a>]. While larger models can often generate useful and tailored exemplars, smaller models may fail to produce valid information [<a href="#ref-24">24</a>]. Ultimately, this approach is constrained by the model's parametric knowledge; it cannot generate reliable information that it was not exposed to during training [<a href="#ref-10">10</a>, <a href="#ref-35">35</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 3: Self-Improvement: Using Internal Knowledge for Fine-Tuning</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Beyond answering single queries, LLMs can use their internal knowledge to generate entire datasets for their own fine-tuning. This self-training process allows models to iteratively improve their capabilities without relying on expensive human-labeled data. </ul>
<p>A broader application of using internal knowledge involves self-improvement frameworks, where an LLM generates synthetic data to fine-tune itself [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-17">17</a>, <a href="#ref-18">18</a>]. This process, often called self-training or bootstrapping, allows a model to learn from its own outputs, reducing the need for costly human annotations or more powerful "teacher" models [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-28">28</a>]. For instance, a model may be prompted to create question-answer pairs, reasoning steps, or other synthetic data, which is then used as a training set to enhance its own abilities [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>, <a href="#ref-19">19</a>].</p>
<p>A key challenge in self-training is ensuring the quality of the generated data, as fine-tuning on incorrect samples can degrade model performance [<a href="#ref-22">22</a>]. To address this, many frameworks incorporate filtering, self-correction, or self-evaluation mechanisms [<a href="#ref-14">14</a>, <a href="#ref-29">29</a>]. These techniques use methods like self-consistency checks or employ the LLM itself as a judge to select only high-quality data for training [<a href="#ref-22">22</a>, <a href="#ref-29">29</a>]. This makes self-improvement a promising direction for creating more capable models while preserving data privacy and reducing costs [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-20">20</a>].</p>
