<h2>Section 1: Background: Parametric vs. External Knowledge Retrieval</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Researchers distinguish between knowledge stored in an LLM's parameters ("parametric knowledge") and knowledge from external sources. Instead of traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), many studies explore using this internal, parametric knowledge to answer questions and perform tasks. </ul>
<p>Yes, numerous studies have investigated using a large language model's (LLM) own internal knowledge as a substitute for retrieval from external sources. LLMs store vast amounts of information from their training data within their model weights, a repository known as <mark>parametric knowledge</mark> [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-32">32</a>]. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems traditionally supplement LLMs by fetching information from external databases, this process can be inefficient and may introduce irrelevant or noisy data [<a href="#ref-21">21</a>, <a href="#ref-35">35</a>, <a href="#ref-38">38</a>]. Consequently, there is significant research interest in methods that prompt LLMs to retrieve or generate information directly from their own parametric knowledge base, which avoids an external search step [<a href="#ref-28">28</a>, <a href="#ref-41">41</a>].</p>
<p>Relying solely on external retrieval is not always optimal, especially when the LLM already possesses the necessary information internally [<a href="#ref-35">35</a>, <a href="#ref-39">39</a>]. This has led to the development of adaptive retrieval strategies, where the model first assesses its own knowledge or uncertainty and only queries an external source when it deems it necessary [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>, <a href="#ref-5">5</a>, <a href="#ref-32">32</a>]. This hybrid approach acknowledges that an LLM's internal knowledge is a valuable and often sufficient resource, prompting investigations into how to best elicit and utilize it without extensive fine-tuning or external dependencies [<a href="#ref-17">17</a>, <a href="#ref-20">20</a>, <a href="#ref-21">21</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 2: <mark>Key Approaches and Examples</mark></h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Key methods involve prompting LLMs to "recite" information from memory, creating pseudo-documents to use as context. Other approaches use self-training and self-distillation, where a model generates its own data and rationales to iteratively fine-tune and improve itself. </ul>
<p>One direct way to use an LLM's internal knowledge is to treat text generation as a form of retrieval [<a href="#ref-28">28</a>]. Frameworks like <b>RECITE</b> and <b>GENREAD</b> prompt an LLM to generate relevant passages or context-specific documents from its own memory based on a query [<a href="#ref-28">28</a>]. These self-generated texts then serve as a pseudo-evidence document that the model conditions on to produce the final answer, bypassing external data sources entirely [<a href="#ref-26">26</a>, <a href="#ref-28">28</a>, <a href="#ref-41">41</a>]. Similarly, the <b>Selfmem</b> framework uses a generator to create a memory pool from its own outputs, which can be used to aid subsequent generation [<a href="#ref-28">28</a>, <a href="#ref-41">41</a>]. <mark>This approach is valued for being self-contained</mark>, but its effectiveness depends on the model's ability to reliably generate accurate information [<a href="#ref-19">19</a>, <a href="#ref-20">20</a>].</p>
<p>A second major approach involves self-training, where an LLM generates data to improve its own capabilities [<a href="#ref-8">8</a>, <a href="#ref-9">9</a>]. For instance, <b>STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner)</b> generates rationales for problems and then fine-tunes itself on the rationales that lead to correct answers, creating a bootstrapping loop [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a href="#ref-14">14</a>]. <b>Self-Instruct</b> and <b>SELF-GUIDE</b> are methodologies where an LLM generates synthetic instruction-following datasets to fine-tune itself, either for general capabilities or for specific tasks [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-12">12</a>]. Going further, <b>RaDis (Rationale Distillation)</b> prompts an LLM to generate rationales for translations, and then uses this self-generated data as a form of self-distillation to preserve the model's general knowledge during fine-tuning [<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]. These methods demonstrate that models can autonomously create high-quality training data without human annotation or external teacher models [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>, <a href="#ref-6">6</a>].</p>

<h2>Section 3: Benefits and Limitations of Internal Retrieval</h2>
<ul> <li> <b>TL;DR:</b> Using internal knowledge is convenient and avoids complex retrieval steps, but is limited by the knowledge encoded during pre-training and risks generating incorrect information. The effectiveness of this approach often depends on the scale and initial capabilities of the language model. </ul>
<p>The primary advantage of generating information from parametric knowledge is that it is self-contained and convenient, avoiding the complexity and latency of an additional retrieval step from an external corpus [<a href="#ref-19">19</a>, <a href="#ref-21">21</a>]. This approach can also yield exemplars or context that is better tailored to a specific problem, as it can draw upon the entirety of the model's training data [<a href="#ref-19">19</a>]. However, this method has limitations. The model's knowledge is static and cannot access information beyond its training cut-off date [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]. Furthermore, there is a risk of generating invalid, hallucinated, or low-quality information, especially if the base LLM is not powerful enough to begin with [<a href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a href="#ref-18">18</a>, <a href="#ref-19">19</a>].</p>
<p>The success of retrieving from internal knowledge is often tied to the scale of the LLM. One study found that for larger models, self-generated exemplars outperformed externally retrieved ones. Conversely, for smaller-scale models, retrieval from a labeled external dataset was more reliable because the smaller models failed to generate useful or valid information on their own [<a href="#ref-19">19</a>]. This highlights that while promising, relying on parametric knowledge requires a model that has already learned the relevant tasks and information effectively during its initial training [<a href="#ref-19">19</a>].</p>
